  to track the motion of individual fluid particles

for each individual particle, you store and update the properties overtime
- position (x, y, z)
- velocity (v)
- mass
- temperature, etc...

in each step of a simulation you calculate the forces that act on every particle
and update their properties accordingly

the particles themselves are the core of the simulation

  tracking fixed point(s) in space and observing properties of the fluid passing through
